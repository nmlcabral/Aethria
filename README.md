# 🌌 Aethria

> **In the silence between dying stars, a new world was born.**  
> Aethria, a planet cradled in the dust of a shattered sun, circles alone in the outer dark. Its seas are unquiet, its skies veined with strange auroras.  
>
> The first sparks of life stir in its soil. Simple forms, fragile and hungry. They move, they change, they struggle. From these small beginnings, something greater may arise — if the planet’s unseen hands allow it.  
>
> You are one of those hands.  
> You may watch without touching, or guide gently, or wield the power to shape the laws themselves. You may even step inside the struggle, a single life among many.  
>
> What emerges on Aethria is not written. It will be discovered.

## 🌱 What is Aethria?

**Aethria** is a lifelong flagship Python project:  
- A **mythic sci-fi game and simulation** where life evolves on a newborn alien world.  
- A **playground for emergent systems**: AI agents, ecosystems, evolving strategies, and procedural worlds.  
- A **hybrid between game and lab**: players can choose their role — *Observer, Gardener, Demiurge, or Co-Inhabitant.*  
- A **vehicle for learning**: Python mastery, AI research, cryptography, game design, and simulation theory.

## 🎯 Vision

- **Grand, tough, but achievable:** a project that grows gradually over years.  
- **Python at the foundation:** clean, modular, PEP8-compliant, testable.  
- **Sustainable growth:** every feature is a new learning journey.  
- **Evolving scope:** from simple survival agents to rich ecosystems, from basic visuals to a living world engine.

## 🛠️ Roadmap (Living Document)

This roadmap will expand as Aethria evolves:

- **Phase 1:** Core simulation (agents move, eat, survive, reproduce).  
- **Phase 2:** Observer role with minimal 2D visualization.  
- **Phase 3:** Gardener role (gentle interventions: add food, terrain, hazards).  
- **Phase 4:** Demiurge role (control the laws: mutation rates, world physics).  
- **Phase 5:** Co-Inhabitant role (player lives inside the world as an agent).  
- **Phase 6+:** Emergent civilizations, markets, cryptographic systems, cosmic events.

## ✨ Status

Aethria is in its **genesis phase**. The world is waiting to be born.
